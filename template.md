# Title and Overview

This section provides broad layout of the purpose of the document, topics covered, and expected outcomes for learners

# Agenda

This section details the next topics (useful for adding to deck for guided presentation)

## Objectives

Include here the desired outcomes for the training.

# Pre-requisites

This section contains all the required technical expectations for this learning (Foundational, Fuctional, Advanced, Expert) as well as resources and dependencies needed (lab environment, software with version requirements, previous learning exercises)

# History

A brief history of this product, solution, technology or process. Include years for context, previous developments, high-level milestones.

## What problem are we solving?

A simple, straightforward explanation for why the product, solution, technology or process exists. Can be either the original intention or the current (even if uninintended) reason for continued relevance for this course.

Examples:

*The original purpose of the world wide web was to meet the demand for automated information-sharing between scientists in universities and institutes around the world.*

*The purpose of the world wide web is to disseminate and perpetuate the existence of cat memes*

# Starter Activity

This adds context to what will be discussed in the Content section by providing high-level, real world examples for which participants can engage and provide feedback.

# Content

All content and learning to be covered in this section, collected using sub-bullets for decks.

## Seven by Seven

* Attempt to follow the 7 x 7 rule:
   * No more than seven bullets/sub-bullet
   * No more than seven words per bullet/sub-bullet

## Addtional Detail

* Organize additional learning into sections of notes:

    *Notes: Here you can add additional details with increased verbosity to support your statements, without the constraints of the seven by seven rule, and without the risk of draining your slide. Plus, this allows for more room for pretty graphs and diagrams of your topic.*

    *Notes:*
    * *If you find your bullets becoming too long and detailed:*
       1. *Add the bullets to the notes section*
       1. *Summarize in the deck*
       1. *Read from the notes*
       1. *???*
       1. *Profit*

## Examples

Provide here a range of examples of content usage to resonate with participants and drive understanding of interactions between the topics discussed and real-world application.

# Exercises

Include in here built-in exercises to show practical application of what is being taught. Exercises can be included at the end of content sections, or in the case of longer trainings, added throughout to build foundational and nuanced skills

## Products and technologies

For products and technologies (Javascript, GoLang, Terraform, Azure, etc.), this can include demos, labs, and walkthroughs. Ensure that all participants are equipped to quickly onboard with labs ahead of time, and that the right tools and permissions are in place for lab learning. Lean on existing prefab lab environments for best success.

## Methodologies and Processes

For methodologies and processes (DevOps patterns, Agile, OKRs, coaching, etc.), thought experiments, role-playing, games and breakout sessions may work best to layer in the required skills and responses to challenges.

# Quiz

Can be a structured (app-driven) or unstructured (questions posed to the group for response) quick activity to gauge understanding and measure accomplishments following the training. Provide opportunity for participants to explain the concepts in their own words and terms.

# Summary and Review

Include here the key takeaways from your content, include opportunities for discussion or feedback from the exercises and lessons learned. Challenge participants on what their next growth opportunity may look like, and encourage them to add to their skills through goalsetting and achievement.

# Further Learning

Conclude with all external resources used in the training for reference, as well as additional documentation and topics for advancement, including additional guided training, links to books and courses, and website documentation.
